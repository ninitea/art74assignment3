                    <p>What exactly is New Media Art? While its fair beginnings started around the early 20th century during the Dada movement, it can be considered a broad category. Essentially, artwork that is composed from any sort of new media technology--such as computers or electronics--can be considered new media art. Furthermore, most of the new media art has some sort of interactivity aspect to it which allows for a more immersive experience in appreciating art. Whether it be through installation art, virtual reality, or any of the other various topics that encompasses new media art—people’s appreciation towards the art is still subjective and--as the saying goes--“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” As this is the case, I shall introduce a few new media artists that inspire me in creating new artwork.</p>

                    <p>The first new media artist I shall introduce is a Youtuber by the name of SuperLouis64. While he is not someone you would generally think of as an artist since he is not actually creating work that one would typically classify as art, the way he implements a different method to playing something is what I feel makes him a good example for a new media artist. In the umbrella term that is new media art, I suppose it would classify as either interactive art or performance. Essentially, his works of art compose of playing various video games, such as Dark Souls, in unconventional methods. One example of this is that he plays Dark Souls with a controller not suited for that kind of gameplay called a Ring Fit. Like the name suggests, the controller is used to help you exercise in its respective game. However, SuperLouis decided to mod the controller for use in Dark Souls and apparently is a good workout considering how exhausted he looked at the end of the video. A one minute video showcasing this idea can be <a href="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AnimatedHomelyAcaciarat-mobile.mp4">found here</a>. In addition to this, he plays with other unconventional methods such as with a banana and ice cube tray from what I can recall. While he is not creating anything new, his innovative way of using the technology available to him to create a new experience of playing a game is what makes me feel like he’s a new media artist. As for how his art inspires my work—there are times I would like to attempt to mod various things to try and play a different game, but unfortunately do not have the experience or knowledge of how to begin. In the future, I hope I would be able to mod as well he does since it seems it deals with programming.</p>

                    <p>Another new media artist I know of is Light Balance. Similar to SuperLouis, Light Balance would most likely fit under the performance and possibly a mixture of installation and interactive art. I first knew of them on America’s Got Talent in 2017 and essentially this group of dancers are artists that attach LEDs to themselves and perform in rhythm to the music. As the music progresses, the lights alter to their actions and can tell a story of their own. In addition to this, the background also has a projection or additional visual light effects. While I’m indifferent to the dancing aspect, the performance overall is still entertaining and admire their use of programmable lights with no technical difficulties. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Ecz_sntDo">video link</a> to all of their performances in 2017. They are a fitting example of new media artists because they use computers to program the lights to flicker or fade at certain intervals and to even change into different designs entirely. In terms of how it would inspire my art, while I would not do activities such as dancing, I would like to learn how to program LEDs properly for props. I would hope that I could at least program lights to flicker at certain intervals or pulse a diffusing light in the foreseeable future to begin with.</p>

                    <p>Last, but not least, the last new media artist is Kenichi Ebina. This is another artist that I found on America’s Got Talent, but he is one of the older contestants back in 2013. Similar to the other two artists, he would fit under performance, but he also probably fits in computer graphics, video art, and sound art. At the beginning of his auditions, he exclusively performed with only robotic dances; however, he becomes what I consider a new media artist during some of his later performances. Following his first performance, his next few performances deals with video projections. One example of his performances is that he uses a video projection of himself that dance battles with his actual self which seemed to be interacting with each other. The one that caught my attention back then was the one where he became a video game character. Essentially, his performance involves him dancing through video game levels which were pre-recorded video graphics he created. The graphics also corresponds to his various dance movements until he ultimately clears the levels. The performance in question can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpS3G60hq4U&feature=youtu.be&t=72">found here</a>. He is a fitting example of a new media artist because he uses technology via the computer graphics to help enhance his dancing performance. While I am not one to do public performances like him, his work inspires me to at least attempt to try and learn how to use computer graphics to project something that can help with my cosplays. Perhaps in the future I will be able to project an activity on the wall and people can interact with it.</p>

                    <p>New Media Art is an ever-growing field. As technology advances, the innovative methods of using it creates endless possibilities for art. As seen by the artists I have chosen, the various ways of implementing technology changes as the years go by. With SuperLouis (being the most recent) in his creative ways of reimagining how to play a game, to Light Balance who creates another perspective of dancing and lights and, even, Kenichi Ebina who brings a nostalgic video game projection to his dancing performance—there are a plethora of ways to express yourself or to bring a more immersive or reimagined experience. Hopefully this class and future classes will spark my creativity like the other artists I have chosen.</p>
