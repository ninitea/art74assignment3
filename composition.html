                    <p>For my Digital Image Composition I decided to alter the Distracted Boyfriend meme. I was debating between swapping out the entire bodies vs. only the heads, but ultimately decided to just stick with replacing the heads since it would be awkward with the wallet. I used my in-game character from Final Fantasy XIV for this and while they did not have the expression the guy had in the meme, I had to edit two different expressions to make it somewhat similar. Unfortunately, the images I took were dark, so I used an overlay layer with a different color to try and match the skin color of the guy in the meme. Before implementing that though, I had to make separate masks for the skin and hair since I wasn't too sure how it would affect the colors. I also found a picture of some merchandise I bought a while back, so I cropped out the background and attached it on the lady's head while also blurring it to match how it should be. </p>

                    <p>My friends keep meme-ing that I buy too much merch (especially of a specific character) so I'll just throw this at them whenever they say it.</p>
